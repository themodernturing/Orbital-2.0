# ORBITAL BAE: SUPPLEMENTARY DECISION SUPPORT FOR PRIVATE EQUITY

**Strategic Proposal: High-Frequency "Outside-In" Screening for Mid-Market Capital Allocation**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

ORBITAL BAE (Buy-side Advisory Engine) provides an automated **External Screening Layer** designed to enhance traditional due diligence for Private Equity, Family Offices, and Corporate M&A. 

Mid-market transactions ($20M–$300M) often lack the budget for continuous "Big Three" consulting audits, leading to significant **diligence friction** and un-flagged material risks. ORBITAL fills this gap by utilizing **High-Frequency Proxy Synthesis (HFPS)** to provide a 3-page "Deal-Flash" audit in minutes. Our tool acts as a **Pre-IC (Investment Committee) Screening Layer**, identifying pricing deltas and operational red flags before expensive manual diligence is engaged.

## 2. Market Gap: The Diligence Friction Problem

In the mid-market, investment teams face a standard set of challenges:
*   **High Screening Costs**: Traditional Commercial Due Diligence (CDD) costs $50k–$150k per deal, limiting the number of targets a firm can rigorously screen.
*   **Information Asymmetry**: Sellers control the data room; Buyers lack a neutral, high-speed method to verify "Physical Truths" (shipping volumes, store throughput, brand health).
*   **Latency in Decision Support**: Human-led research takes weeks, while deal windows and competitive bidding require execution in days.

## 3. Product Specification: BAE Deal-Flash (V1)

ORBITAL BAE focuses 100% on a single, high-fidelity wedge: **Buy-Side Deal Screening.**

### 3.1 The Value Proposition
*   **Pre-IC Red Flag Detection**: Identify material risks (e.g., declining trade velocity or brand decay) before high-ticket auditors are signed.
*   **Negotiation Leverage**: Provide the investment team with "Physical Truth" evidence to challenge seller valuations.
*   **Standardized Signaling**: A repeatable framework for assessing retail and manufacturing targets across multiple geographies.

### 3.2 Signal Framework
1.  **Throughput Verification**: Cross-referencing seller growth claims against **Global Trade Manifests** (Physical Import/Export volumes).
2.  **Yield Gap Analysis**: Benchmarking target store-level performance against **Public-Sector Peer Physics** (Bata/Service).
3.  **Sentiment Integrity Gap**: Analysis of structural brand-trust decay across **External Sentiment Indices**.

## 4. Liability & Data Provenance Framework

Institutional adoption requires clear boundaries on data and liability.

*   **Decision-Support Layer**: ORBITAL BAE is positioned as a **Supplementary Analytical Tool**. Our reports provide "High-Probability Hypotheses" based on external signals—not a replacement for legal, tax, or internal financial audits.
*   **Data Aggregation**: We utilize non-confidential, external proxies including:
    *   Aggregated Customs Manifests (Trade Velocity).
    *   Public Peer Benchmarking (Efficiency Ratios).
    *   Audited Sentiment Indices (Brand Risk).
    *   Geographic Yield Modeling (Physical Footprint Analysis).

## 5. Pricing & Business Model

ORBITAL BAE utilizes a transactional model designed for rapid adoption in the UK, UAE, and regional financial hubs.

| Product Tier | Application | Pricing (Est.) |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-Deal Flash** | Individual Target Screening | $2,500 per report |

| **Enterprise License** | Pilot Deployment (SaaS) | $5,000 / month |

## 6. Validation & Back-Testing Roadmap (30-Day Sprint)

We do not raise on vision; we raise on verified signal accuracy.

*   **Phase I: Back-Testing (Days 1–15)**: Run ORBITAL logic on 10 historical transactions (5 successful exits, 5 "lemons"). Demonstrate that the BAE signals would have identified the material risks and upsides in >80% of cases.
*   **Phase II: Paid Pilot (Days 16–30)**: Onboard 2 boutique PE firms for live screening of current pipeline targets.
*   **Phase III: Institutional Refinement**: Adjust the "Sector Physics" logic based on feedback from PE Associates and IC Members.

## 7. Competitive Moat: The Proprietary Niche

The MOAT is not "AI"—it is the **Standardized Signal Framework** focused on the Retail/Manufacturing niche.
1.  **Repeatability**: Unlike bespoke consulting, ORBITAL provides a consistent "Score" that allows firms to compare targets side-by-side.
2.  **Methodology Branding**: Creating the "HFPS Standard" for mid-market valuation verification.
3.  **Data Moat**: Over time, ORBITAL aggregates a proprietary database of private firm "Physical Performance" that manual consultants cannot match.

---

## 8. Conclusion: Neutralizing Risk through Physical Truth

ORBITAL BAE reduces the cost of being wrong. By providing an objective, machine-speed screening layer, we enable mid-market investors to move with the same strategic certainty as the world's largest funds.
