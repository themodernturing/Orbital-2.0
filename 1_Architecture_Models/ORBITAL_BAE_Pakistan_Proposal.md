# ORBITAL BAE: PRIVATE EQUITY INTELLIGENCE (PAKISTAN EDITION)

**Strategic Proposal: Automated Buy-Side Due Diligence for the Pakistan Mid-Market**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

ORBITAL BAE Pakistan is an automated **Decision Support Layer** designed for the unique challenges of the Pakistani capital market. 

In Pakistan, the "Information Gap" between a seller's claims and the actual "Physical Truth" is the single greatest barrier to mid-market M&A. Sellers often provide inconsistent data to the FBR and SECP, making traditional diligence both slow and unreliable.

ORBITAL solves this by using **High-Frequency Proxy Synthesis (HFPS)** to verify a company's performance from the "Outside-In." We provide **Institutional-Grade Audit Screens** in 2-5 minutes, allowing local PE firms, Family Offices, and Corporate Acquirers to identify material risks before spending millions on manual audits.

## 2. The Local Problem: The "Skepticism Gap"

Diligence in Pakistan faces three structural hurdles:
*   **Operational-to-Declared Variance**: Financial statements often diverge from operational indicators. Investors struggle to verify the true yield in a "low-transparency" environment.
*   **High Consultant Friction**: Hiring Tier-1 consultants for a PKR 500M deal is often prohibitively expensive (PKR 5M - 15M+).
*   **Verification Speed**: In a high-volatility economy, a 90-day diligence cycle often results in a "stale" valuation by the time the deal closes.

## 3. The ORBITAL Solution: Physical Truth Verification

We verify the business where it cannot be hidden:
1.  **Trade Integrity (HS-Code Audit)**: We cross-reference claimed growth against actual **Import/Export Manifests**. We detect "Trade Volume Anomalies."
2.  **Sector Physics (Efficiency Benchmarking)**: We compare local targets against regional leaders (e.g., Bata/Service). If a footwear retailer turns stock 1.5x while the industry standard is 3.5x, we quantify the **"Trapped Capital"** risk.
3.  **The ORBITAL Risk Index**: A numeric, repeatable scoring framework (0-100).
    *   **Green (<30)**: High Operational Fidelity.
    *   **Amber (30-60)**: Asset-Efficiency Gap (Trapped Capital).
    *   **Red (60+)**: Significant Signal Divergence (Diagnostic Red Flag).

## 6. The 30-Day Launch Roadmap (Pakistan Pilot)

1.  **Sector Physics Calibration**: Finalize the "Truth Benchmarks" for the 3 largest sectors: **Retail (Footwear/Apparel)**, **Manufacturing (textile)**, and **Agri-Export**.
2.  **Back-Test Validation**: Run the engine against 5 recent local deals that failed or succeeded. Prove that the "Physical Signals" predicted the outcome.
3.  **Paid Pilots**: Partner with 1 Karachi-based and 1 Lahore-based investment firm to run live deal screens.

## 7. The Disruptive Moat

ORBITAL is the only platform that speaks the language of **McKinsey Logic** but operates at the price and speed of a **local utility**. 

We don't ask the seller for permission to audit them; we audit the **Signals** they leave in the global economy. In Pakistan, this "Outside-In" approach is the only way to find the **Truth**.
