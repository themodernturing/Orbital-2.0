# ORBITAL EXTERNAL
## Deterministic Sector Intelligence & Structural Risk System
### Enterprise Product Architecture — Agile Edition (Locked)

# 1. Executive Overview

Orbital External is a deterministic sector intelligence system that provides independent structural risk visibility on any company using external signal modeling.

It is designed to answer:

> What is the true structural position of this company within its sector — and how is that position changing?

Orbital External synthesizes trade proxies, sector benchmarks, competitive density signals, and structural variance modeling into board-ready intelligence.

It operates independently of internal disclosures and does not require ERP integration.

Orbital External is not:
* A news summarizer
* A scraping-based AI report
* A regulatory audit
* A compliance certification tool
* A black-box machine learning model

It is a structured signal intelligence system built on locked deterministic modeling.

---

# 2. Strategic Philosophy

Financial statements show historical performance.
Market physics move continuously.

Most strategic decisions fail because:
* Sector deterioration is detected too late
* Competitive shifts are misjudged
* Trade intensity drift is invisible
* Structural variance is misunderstood

Orbital External closes the gap between:
**Reported financial history** and **Real-time sector physics**.

It externalizes structural signal reality in a comparable, repeatable format.

---

# 3. System Architecture

Orbital External operates on a deterministic modeling framework.
All sector models include predefined signal weights and logic structures that are calibrated before deployment.

AI is used only to translate deterministic outputs into executive-grade narrative.
AI does not modify scoring formulas or risk calculations.

## 3.1 Sector Physics Library
Each supported sector contains:
* Defined structural signals
* Trade proxy mappings
* Operational intensity benchmarks
* Competitive density baselines
* Structural variance thresholds

Sector logic is:
* Calibrated manually
* Locked at runtime
* Applied consistently across companies

---

## 3.2 Deterministic Signal Engine
Orbital External synthesizes, where applicable:
* Import and export trade proxies
* Supply chain activity indicators
* Competitive footprint signals
* Revenue density modeling
* Sector stress markers
* Structural drift detection

---

## 3.3 ORBITAL Structural Risk Index
Every company analyzed receives:
* Structural Risk Score (0–100)
* Risk Band (Green / Amber / Red)
* Top structural variance drivers
* Sector-relative position summary

---

# Tier 2 — Intelligence Console
**Purpose**: Interactive intelligence for high-stakes evaluation environments.

**Includes**: Tier 1 + Interactive signal drill-down, Comparative view (up to 2 competitors), Structural drift visualization, Signal timeline tracking, and Executive query interface.

**Fixed Investment**: PKR 1,250,000 per company

---

# Tier 3 — Sector Watch Retainer
**Purpose**: Continuous structural monitoring across selected companies within one sector.

**Includes**: Monthly risk recalibration, Drift detection summary, Signal movement analysis, 2–4 page executive memo, and Monthly review call.

**Fixed Investment**: PKR 450,000 per month (Up to 3 companies, 6-month minimum)

---

# 5. Data & Methodology Transparency
Orbital External uses public and proxy-based signal inputs. It does not require internal ERP access or ingest confidential accounting records. It ensures operational independence and credibility alignment.

---

# 6. Capability Scope
Orbital External provides deterministic signal modeling and executive reporting. It does not provide live API integrations, custom ERP connectors, regulatory certification, or legal audit assurance. All outputs are intelligence-support tools.

---

# 7. Value Framework
If a decision involves exposure of PKR 500M – 5B, an intelligence investment of PKR 500k – 1.25M represents a small fraction (0.1% - 0.25%) of potential structural risk.

# 8. Commercial Growth Ladder
Executive Brief → Intelligence Console → Sector Watch Retainer.

---

# 9. Strategic Identity
Orbital External is a Deterministic Structural Intelligence Layer that quantify sector variance, detects drift early, and supports capital decision-making.
