# ORBITAL BAE: EXTERNAL HUNTING SYSTEM
## PE Due-Diligence & Portfolio Audit Layer
### Enterprise Product Model — Locked V2.0 Edition

---

# 1. Executive Positioning

ORBITAL BAE is a Forensic Hunting System designed for Private Equity (PE) firms, VCs, and Institutional Bidders. 

It is the "Soldier" to the "General" (Orbital Internal). While Internal provides governance, **BAE provides Intelligence-at-the-Point-of-Attack.**

It is used to:
* Verify external target claims.
* Detect physical divergence before a deal closes.
* Monitor portfolio companies for "Strategic Decay."

This is not a dashboard.
This is a tactical investigative weapon.

# 2. System Philosophy

In a deal environment, information asymmetry is the enemy. 

Target companies present a "perfect" version of the truth. ORBITAL BAE applies **Physical Physics** (Manifests, Energy, Benchmarks) to detect the "Physical Truth."

We do not ask the target for data. 
We count the output from the satellite view.
