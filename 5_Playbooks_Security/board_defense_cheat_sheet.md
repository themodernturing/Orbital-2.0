# Board Defense Cheat-Sheet (For Khadija)

This is a simple guide to answering the "How do you know?" questions. Keep it simple and focus on the **Physical Truth.**

### The "Ammar / Orbital" Opening
If they ask who gave these answers, say: 
*"Orbital has provided these answers based on Global Institutional Standards. We aren't guessing your private books; we are looking at the Physical Footprint you leave in the world."*

### 1. The FBR Question
**The Objection**: "Nobody gives correct data to FBR. Neither do we, nor others. Your data must be wrong."
**The Answer**: "Sir, we actually agree with you. That’s why **we didn't use FBR data.** We used **'Outside-In' signals** that you cannot hide. For example, we tracked your **194 Import Shipments** and **31 Export Shipments** recorded over the **last 36 months (2022-2025).** You can lie to the tax man, but you can't lie to the ship. We counted the actual shoes arriving in your warehouse. If the boxes arrived but the money didn't grow, there is a leak."

### 2. The Footfall Question
**The Objection**: "How do you know mall footfall or where we stand?"
**The Answer**: "We look at the **'Yield Gap.'** We know the total mall traffic (it's public data for malls) and we know what your competitors (Bata/Service) make in those same malls because they are public companies. If they are making more than you in the same building, that is the PKR 1 Billion opportunity we found."

### 3. The Inventory Question (Sector Physics)
**The Objection**: "Where did you get our inventory details? What is 'Aged'?"
**The Answer**: "We use **Sector Physics.** These are the 'Laws of Retail' that work the same way regardless of what is in your ledger. In footwear, if a shoe sits for **6 months (180 days)**, it is 'Aged' because fashion and seasons change. This isn't a guess—it's the **Physics of Efficiency.** We used the **3.5x turnover benchmark** because that's the absolute standard for professional retailers (Bata/Service). If you aren't hitting that number, you're not just slow—you're losing money every day."

### 4. What is Capital Velocity?
**The Answer**: "It's just **The Speed of Money.** How fast does your Rs. 100 turn into Rs. 120 so you can spend it again? Fast money is a weapon; slow money (Aged Inventory) is a weight that holds you back."

### The Moat: Protecting the Source (For Khadija)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do not name specific websites (like Volza or Trustpilot) unless forced.**

*   **Instead of Volza**: Say "Global Trade Manifest Aggregators."
*   **Instead of Trustpilot**: Say "Audited Sentiment Indices."
*   **Instead of Google Maps**: Say "Geographic Satellite & Traffic Modeling."

**The Logic**: People pay for the **Synthesis**, not just the data. Keep the source categorized so ORBITAL remains the "Secret Sauce."
