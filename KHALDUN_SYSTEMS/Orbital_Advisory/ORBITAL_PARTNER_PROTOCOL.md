# ORBITAL INTERNAL (V3.0)
## Capital Direction & Strategic Governance System

**Khaldun Systems — Decision Infrastructure Suite**
**Status: Institutional Product Architecture (Locked)**

---

## 1. Executive Overview

Orbital Internal is an AI-powered Capital Direction System built for:
- Enterprise CEOs
- Boards of Directors
- Founder-led organizations
- Multi-unit operators

It is designed to answer one governance-critical question:
> **Where should capital move next — and what is the quantified financial impact of that movement?**

Orbital converts external market signals and internal performance data into:
- Ranked capital allocation priorities
- Quantified opportunity ranges
- Competitive structural comparisons
- Forward simulations (6–12 month horizon)
- Continuous execution recalibration

**Orbital is not consulting. Orbital is not a dashboard.**
**Orbital is recurring capital allocation infrastructure.**

---

## 2. Strategic Philosophy

Most enterprises operate with:
- Trapped working capital
- Delayed response to market shifts
- Fragmented reporting
- Weak competitor visibility
- Narrative-based decision-making

Orbital replaces reactive strategy with:
> **Outside-In Intelligence + Deterministic Financial Logic + Continuous Governance**

It first reveals blind spots. Then quantifies structural inefficiencies. Then governs capital correction over time.

## 3. Product Architecture — Three-Phase Model

### PHASE 0 — Executive Intelligence Brief
**(Entry Layer | Limited Scope)**

**Purpose:** Demonstrate outside-in structural intelligence and reveal hidden inefficiencies.
**Data Source:** Public signals + proprietary AI inference engine.
**Deliverables:**
- 3–5 high-impact blind spot findings
- Limited competitor structural divergence analysis
- 1–2 predictive insights
- Methodology transparency sample
- Limited interactive HTML preview
- Controlled RAG demonstration

**Characteristics:**
- No heavy internal data required
- No ERP integration
- Strict scope boundary
- Designed to create executive clarity

**Objective:**
- Establish authority
- Trigger urgency
- Position Orbital as infrastructure

*Scope is intentionally limited to preserve value of Phase 1.*

---

### PHASE 1 — Strategic Diagnostic & Intelligence Build
**(Core Paid Product)**

**Purpose:** Quantify structural inefficiencies and build full decision infrastructure.

**Internal Calibration Inputs (Required):**
- Financial summary
- Working capital structure
- Inventory data
- Revenue segmentation
- Sourcing framework
*Full ERP integration is not required.*

**Deliverables:**
1. Full Capital Diagnostic
2. Ranked Opportunity Stack (ROI-weighted)
3. Quantified “Size of the Prize” (PKR/USD range)
4. Competitive Structural Comparison
5. Full Interactive HTML Intelligence Portal
6. Predictive Simulation Engine (6–12 months)
7. Sensitivity Analysis (Worst/Base/Best)
8. Full RAG Query Access
9. Forensic Traceability Layer
10. Board-Ready Institutional Report

**Forensic Traceability:**
Each recommendation is traceable to:
- External signal source
- Internal performance metric
- Applied deterministic financial logic
- Projection assumption set
*This ensures auditability and governance credibility.*

---

### PHASE 2 — Strategic Governance & Execution Retainer
**(Recurring Infrastructure Layer)**
*Minimum 6-month commitment.*

**Purpose:** Convert diagnosis into sustained capital discipline.
**Monthly Deliverables:**
- Updated Capital Ranking
- Signal Recalibration
- Execution Drift Detection
- Competitive Divergence Update
- Allocation Adjustment Recommendations
- Board Intelligence Memo
- Executive Review Session

**Optional Modules:**
- AI Enablement Sprint (structured scope)
- War Room Console (live decision cockpit)

---

## 4. Commercial Structure

### Phase 1 — Strategic Diagnostic
**Pakistan Market Pricing:** PKR 2,000,000 – 2,800,000
**Dependent on:**
- Organizational complexity
- Multi-unit scale
- Data depth required
- Sector volatility
*Includes full intelligence build and executive session.*

### Phase 2 — Governance Retainer
**Minimum 6 months**
**Mid-Market Enterprise:** PKR 700,000 per month
**Large Enterprise:** PKR 1,000,000 – 1,400,000 per month
*Includes recalibration, monitoring, reporting, and governance.*

---

## 5. Performance Alignment Framework (Selective)

Orbital Internal may include an optional Performance Alignment overlay for selected enterprise engagements. This mechanism aligns Khaldun Systems with measurable capital efficiency improvements beyond the agreed baseline.

**This is not a substitute for fixed fees. It is an incentive overlay.**

### 5.1 Purpose
- Reinforce execution seriousness
- Align incentives with measurable financial outcomes
- Reward capital efficiency gains
- Demonstrate confidence in Orbital’s impact

### 5.2 Eligibility Criteria
Activated only when:
- A clear financial baseline is established during Phase 1
- The targeted efficiency metric is quantifiable
- Attribution can be reasonably isolated
- Enterprise finance team agrees to definitions
- Impact can be audited or verified

### 5.3 Baseline Definition
Before Phase 2 begins, both parties define:
- Target metric
- Numerical baseline
- Measurement method
- Time horizon
- Reporting cadence

*Examples: Reduction in working capital days, Inventory compression (PKR value), Procurement savings, Released liquidity, Margin improvement.*

### 5.4 Fee Structure
**If activated:** 2% – 5% of verified capital efficiency improvement beyond baseline.
*Example: Baseline inefficiency = PKR 500M. Verified recovery = PKR 300M. At 3% alignment: Performance Fee = PKR 9M. Paid separately from retainer.*

### 5.5 Verification & Audit
Performance measurement must be:
- Financially auditable
- Based on documented accounting records
- Jointly reviewed
- Confirmed in writing prior to invoicing

*Execution responsibility remains with the Enterprise. Orbital provides decision infrastructure — not operational control.*

## 6. Data Sovereignty & Security

Orbital is designed for institutional compliance.
- Client data processed in agreed secure environments
- No resale or reuse outside engagement scope
- Cross-client learning is anonymized
- Data retention defined contractually
- Security documentation available upon request.

---

## 7. Client Commitment Requirements

Phase 1 requires:
- Designated Executive Sponsor (CFO / COO / Strategy Lead)
- 3–4 hours of executive access during diagnostic window
- Timely access to agreed documentation
*Without executive participation, governance cannot be institutionalized.*

---

## 8. Renewal & Value Realization Milestone

At Month 5 of Phase 2, Orbital conducts a **Forward Impact Review**:
- Realized capital gains
- Execution drift analysis
- Updated opportunity map
- 6–12 month forward simulation

This establishes delivered value, remaining inefficiency, and the strategic rationale for continuation. **Renewal becomes data-driven.**

---

## 9. Scope Boundaries

Orbital does **NOT**:
- Implement ERP systems
- Act as internal BI team
- Execute operational restructuring
- Provide open-ended consulting

*Orbital provides decision intelligence and governance. AI enablement modules are structured and scoped.*

---

## 10. Delivery Timeline

- **Phase 0:** 1–2 weeks
- **Phase 1:** 30–45 days
- **Phase 2:** 6 months minimum

---

## 11. Strategic Identity

Orbital Internal is:
- Deterministic
- Forensically traceable
- Simulation-backed
- Board-ready
- Recurring-first
- Infrastructure-grade

**Calculated Capital. Calibrated Governance.**
