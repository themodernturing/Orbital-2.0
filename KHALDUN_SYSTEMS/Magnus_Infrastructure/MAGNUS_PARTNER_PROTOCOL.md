# MAGNUS MARKETS (V2.1)
## Deterministic Structural Intelligence Infrastructure

**Khaldun Systems — Institutional Intelligence Division**
**Status: Institutional Product Architecture (Locked)**

---

## 1. Executive Overview

Magnus Markets is a deterministic structural intelligence infrastructure designed for capital decision-makers.

It answers one institutional question:
> **What is the true structural position of this company within its sector — and how is that position evolving over time?**

Magnus converts external signal physics into quantified structural intelligence. It provides:
- Structural Risk Indexing
- Competitive divergence tracking
- Narrative variance detection
- Scenario modeling
- Probability-calibrated forward indicators
- Live drift monitoring

**Magnus is not a report provider. Magnus is a live structural intelligence system.**

---

## 2. Strategic Philosophy

Financial statements are historical snapshots. Markets operate on continuous physics. Capital misallocation occurs when:
- Structural deterioration is detected too late
- Competitive divergence goes unnoticed
- Narrative and reality drift apart
- Signal latency hides risk buildup

Magnus bridges **reported financial history** and **live structural sector reality.** It functions as a neutral auditor of structural physics.

## 3. Core Architecture

Magnus operates on deterministic modeling. AI is used for signal ingestion, pattern synthesis, and narrative translation. **AI does NOT override scoring formulas** or mutate signal weights. All structural logic is version-controlled and locked.

### 3.1 Signal Latency Mapping

| Signal Type         | Typical Refresh | Latency Range |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Trade Proxies       | 24–72 hours     | Low           |
| Commodity Pricing   | Intraday        | Real-time     |
| Competitive Signals | Weekly          | Medium        |
| Sector Benchmarks   | Monthly         | High          |
| Corporate Filings   | Event-based     | Immediate     |

---

### 3.2 Narrative Divergence Indicator (NDI)

Magnus measures structural variance between the **public company narrative** and **observed structural signal reality.** NDI functions as a governance risk flag for:
- Forward guidance tone vs. observed trade signals
- Competitive intensity shifts vs. internal disclosures
- Sector stress markers vs. earnings narratives

---

## 4. Quantitative Integrity Framework (The 5 Pillars)

1. **Prediction Registry**: All forward-looking outputs are logged for empirical tracking.
2. **Probability Calibration**: Tracking predicted vs. realized outcome frequency.
3. **Quant Defensibility**: Conclusions are traceable via a **Trace Chain** (Signal → Driver → Conclusion).
4. **Scenario Modeling Rigor**: Standardized Best/Base/Worst case range modeling.
5. **Controlled Backtesting**: Historical replay using frozen data snapshots with no leakage.

## 6. Data Sovereignty & Independence

Magnus remains independent of subject company disclosures. It does not require ERP integration or ingest confidential records. Neutrality is the shield that ensures Magnus remains the universal data infrastructure.

---

## 7. Strategic Identity

Magnus Markets is: **Deterministic. Forensically Traceable. Probability-Calibrated. Version-Controlled. Subscription-Based.**

**Magnus does not trade. Magnus does not allocate capital. Magnus provides structural intelligence.**
