# MAGNUS INFRASTRUCTURE MANIFEST
**INSTITUTIONAL INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE**
*Probability-Calibrated Truth for Capital Markets.*

---

## 1. MISSION
To serve as the neutral, institutional-grade data infrastructure for capital decision-making. Magnus does not trade; Magnus validates.

## 2. THE 5 INSTITUTIONAL PILLARS

### A. Probability Calibration
- **Requirement**: Predicted vs. Observed frequency mapping.
- **Metric**: Brier Score (< 0.25 target).
- **Output**: Reliability Plot (Calibrated weekly).

### B. Quant Defensibility
- **Requirement**: "Evidence Packs" for every high-impact claim.
- **Components**: Driver Ranking, Sensitivity Assumptions, and Historical Correlation data.
- **Auditability**: Every claim must be traceable to the Signal Layer.

### C. Scenario Math Rigor
- **Requirement**: Explicit assumption versioning.
- **Modeling**: Best/Base/Worst case range modeling.
- **Elasticity**: Documented pass-through and lag assumptions per sector.

### D. Backtesting
- **Requirement**: Strict "No-Leakage" discipline (t-0 data only).
- **Metrics**: Precision/Recall, AUC, and Hit Rate.
- **Certification**: A formal "Validation Note" for every major model version.

### E. Historical Validation
- **Requirement**: Vetted Signal Library.
- **Process**: Lead/Lag analysis and stability testing across multiple company cycles.

## 3. THE "NO-TRADE" DOCTRINE
Magnus maintains a position of absolute neutrality to preserve institutional trust.
- Magnus does not trade or allocate capital.
- Magnus outputs are **Advisory Intelligence Tools**, not financial certifications.
- Neutrality is the shield that ensures Magnus remains the **Universal Data Infrastructure.**

## 4. THE PREDICTION REGISTRY
Magnus maintains a formal `PREDICTION_REGISTRY.json` of every forward-looking statement to measure and improve calibration over time.
- **Status**: Operational | Locked for Audit.

## 4. SUB-PRODUCTS
- **Magnus Sentinel**: High-frequency risk monitoring.
- **Magnus Oracle**: Calibrated prediction engine for earnings/margin surprises.
- **Magnus Ledger**: The verified database of backtested performance.
