# MAGNUS INFRASTRUCTURE MANIFEST
**INSTITUTIONAL INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE**
*Probability-Calibrated Truth for Capital Markets.*

---

## 1. MISSION
To serve as the neutral, institutional-grade data infrastructure for capital decision-making. Magnus does not trade; Magnus validates.

## 2. THE 5 INSTITUTIONAL PILLARS
1. **Probability Calibration**: Moving from adjectives to precise, backtested likelihoods (e.g., 70% probability of revenue miss).
2. **Quant Defensibility**: Transparent reasoning stacks. Show the signal weights and historical correlations.
3. **Scenario Math Rigor**: Explicit elasticity assumptions and range modeling (Best/Base/Worst).
4. **Backtesting**: Systematic testing of signals against historical data with no hindsight bias.
5. **Historical Validation**: Proving that signals (e.g., Container Flow) actually correlate with outcomes across multiple sectors.

## 3. THE PREDICTION REGISTRY
Magnus maintains a formal registry of every forward-looking statement to measure and improve calibration over time.

## 4. SUB-PRODUCTS
- **Magnus Sentinel**: High-frequency risk monitoring.
- **Magnus Oracle**: Calibrated prediction engine for earnings/margin surprises.
- **Magnus Ledger**: The verified database of backtested performance.
