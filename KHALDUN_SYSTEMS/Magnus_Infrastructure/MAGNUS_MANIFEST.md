# MAGNUS INFRASTRUCTURE MANIFEST
**INSTITUTIONAL INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE**
*Probability-Calibrated Truth for Capital Markets.*

---

## 1. MISSION
To serve as the neutral, institutional-grade data infrastructure for capital decision-making. Magnus does not trade; Magnus validates.

## 2. THE 5 INSTITUTIONAL PILLARS

### A. Probability Calibration
- **Requirement**: Predicted vs. Observed frequency mapping.
- **Metric**: Brier Score (< 0.25 target).
- **Output**: Reliability Plot (Calibrated weekly).

### B. Quant Defensibility
- **Requirement**: "Evidence Packs" for every high-impact claim.
- **Components**: Driver Ranking/Contribution Bands, Sensitivity Assumptions, and Historical Correlation data.
- **Auditability**: Every claim must be traceable via a **Trace Chain** (Signal → Driver → Conclusion).
- **Nuance**: Proprietary weights remain hidden behind driver rankings and stability tests.

### C. Scenario Math Rigor
- **Requirement**: Explicit assumption versioning via **Scenario Objects**.
- **Modeling**: Standardized Best/Base/Worst case range modeling.
- **Elasticity**: Documented pass-through, lag, and distribution assumptions per sector.

### D. Backtesting
- **Requirement**: Strict "No-Leakage" discipline (t-0 data only).
- **Metrics**: Precision/Recall, AUC, and Hit Rate by sector and horizon.
- **Certification**: A formal "Magnus Validation Note" for every major model version.

### E. Historical Validation
- **Requirement**: Vetted **Signal Validation Cards**.
- **Process**: Lead/Lag analysis and stability testing across multiple company cycles.
- **Output**: A scientific Signal Validation Card including failure modes.

## 3. THE "NO-TRADE" DOCTRINE
Magnus maintains a position of absolute neutrality to preserve institutional trust.
- Magnus **does not trade**, allocate capital, or provide execution services.
- Magnus outputs are **Advisory Intelligence Tools**, not financial certifications.
- Neutrality is the shield that ensures Magnus remains the **Universal Data Infrastructure.**

## 4. THE 12-MONTH VALIDATION ROADMAP
To reach "Scientifically Undeniable" status, Magnus must achieve:
- **Logged Predictions**: N total events across Y sectors.
- **Calibration Accuracy**: Probability calibration within ±X% in key bands.
- **Leakage-Free Logs**: A verifiable track record of backtests without hindsight bias.
- **Evidence Packs**: Standardized documentation for any high-impact claim.

## 4. THE PREDICTION REGISTRY
Magnus maintains a formal `PREDICTION_REGISTRY.json` of every forward-looking statement to measure and improve calibration over time.
- **Status**: Operational | Locked for Audit.

## 4. SUB-PRODUCTS
- **Magnus Sentinel**: High-frequency risk monitoring.
- **Magnus Oracle**: Calibrated prediction engine for earnings/margin surprises.
- **Magnus Ledger**: The verified database of backtested performance.
