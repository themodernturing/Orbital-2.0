## 1. TELECOM (KSA Case Study)
- **Tower Yield**: (Total Subscribers / Total Tower Count). Benchmark: 1,500 - 2,200.
- **Generator Dependency Index**: Measuring Opex variance in remote clusters using high-frequency proxy signals.
- **Decision Lag Metric**: Measuring the cost of waiting for traditional reports vs. "Outside-In" signals.

## 2. RETAIL & FOOTWEAR (Imperial/Unze Study)
- **Inventory Turnover (ITR)**: Benchmark 3.5x - 4.5x. Anything < 2.5x is flagged as "Trapped Capital."
- **Revenue per Sq Ft (RPSF)**: Tier-1 Mall Benchmark (PKR 120k - 180k).
- **Import Density Correlation**: Port Shipment Weight (KG) vs. Claimed Revenue Growth. Variance > 15% = Growth Integrity Risk.

## 3. MANUFACTURING & TEXTILE (GFC/Khurshid Study)
- **Energy Yield Stress**: Export Volume / Grid Consumption Rate. Measures efficiency against high energy tariffs.
- **Working Capital Velocity**: The time from Raw Material import to finished Export.
- **Sourcing "Middleman Tax"**: The 8-12% margin gap identified between Local Distributor sourcing and Direct Import (LME-linked).
