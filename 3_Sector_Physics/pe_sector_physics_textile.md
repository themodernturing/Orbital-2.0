# ORBITAL BAE: TEXTILE SECTOR PHYSICS (PAKISTAN)
**REVISION 3.3 | DETERMINISTIC LOGIC LOCK**

---

## 1. Sector Definition
*   **Wedge**: Mid-Market Textile Exporters (Vertically Integrated).
*   **Benchmark Peer**: Interloop Limited (The "Gold Standard" of Efficiency).
*   **Data Source**: Pakistan Customs Manifests (HS 61xx, 62xx), Energy Grids, PSX Financials, Regional Labor Indices.

## 2. The 10 Deterministic Signals

| # | Signal ID | Weight | Metric Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `trade_integrity` | 20% | Divergence between **Port Shipment Weight (KG)** and **Claimed Revenue Growth**. |
| 02 | `energy_yield_stress` | 15% | **Export Volume / Grid Consumption Rate**. Measures efficiency against PKR 50/unit energy tariffs. |
| 03 | `inventory_lockup` | 15% | **Yarn/Fabric Days Outstanding**. Benchmarked against Interloop (Target: <110 days). |
| 04 | `fx_exposure_delta` | 10% | **Imported Raw Material (Cotton/Chem) vs. Export Earnings**. Measures net devaluation hit. |
| 05 | `buyer_retention` | 10% | **Consignee Persistence Index**. Tracking top-3 global buyers (Walmart/H&M/Nike) in manifest history. |
| 06 | `unit_value_premium` | 10% | **Average USD / KG exported**. High-tier (Garments) vs. Low-tier (Greige Fabric). |
| 07 | `shipping_latency` | 5% | **Factory-to-Port lead time**. Indicator of logistics bottleneck and cash-flow friction. |
| 08 | `capacity_util_proxy` | 5% | **High-Frequency Electricity usage patterns**. Detects idle looms before quarterly reports. |
| 09 | `gsp_compliance_risk` | 5% | **Sustainability/ESG Proxy** (Energy mix and certification status). |
| 10 | `regional_stability` | 5% | **Mill Location Risk** (Security, Labor disputes, Infrastructure fragility). |

## 3. The ORBITAL Scoring Formula

The **ORBITAL Risk Index (0-100)** is calculated as follows:

$$Score = \sum_{i=1}^{10} (SignalV_i \times Weight_i)$$

### Risk Banding:
*   **< 30 (Green)**: **Operational Alpha**. Physical signals exceed claims.
*   **30 - 60 (Amber)**: **Efficiency Lag**. Profit is being leaked through inventory or energy stress.
*   **> 60 (Red)**: **Material Divergence**. Valuation cannot be sustained by physical reality.

## 4. The "Stylo vs. MTM" Back-Test Logic

To validate MTM in 3 minutes, the engine must compare:
1.  **MTM Export Velocity** vs. **Industry Average**.
2.  **MTM Unit Value** vs. **Interloop Unit Value**.
3.  **MTM Inventory Days** vs. **Standard Physics**.

Any variance >15% is automatically flagged as **"Price Adjustment Leverage."**

## 5. Output structure (Fixed)
1.  **ORBITAL Index**: Numeric Score.
2.  **Signal Mapping**: The top 3 variances identified.
3.  **Financial Translation**: Trapped Capital estimate (PKR) + Revenue Durability Verdict.
4.  **Leverage Verdict**: Specific recommended valuation discount.
