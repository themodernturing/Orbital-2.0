# ORBITAL BAE: THE FOOTWEAR INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL (V4)

**Institutional Decision Support for Mid-Market Footwear & Retail Acquisitions**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

ORBITAL BAE (Buy-side Advisory Engine) is a specialized **Commercial Due Diligence (CDD) Screening Layer** designed for mid-market private equity and family offices. 

Version 4 of the protocol is codified specifically for the **Footwear (Retail & Manufacturing)** sector. We bridge the gap between "Seller Narratives" and "Physical Truth" by mapping high-frequency external signals (Trade Manifests, Store Throughput, and Sentiment Indices) to core Private Equity financial priorities. 

**The Outcome**: A standardized **ORBITAL Score** and a 3-page "Signal-Flash" report delivered within 24 hours of request, enabling investment teams to flag material risks before committing to expensive manual audits.

## 2. The "Footwear Wedge": Why This Sector?

Footwear is a high-visibility, trade-exposed sector where operational efficiency is perfectly correlated to physical signals.
*   **Inventory Velocity**: Product aging is the #1 value-killer in footwear fashion cycles.
*   **Trade Dependency**: High reliance on HS-Code tracked imports (China/India) makes turnover verification irrefutable.
*   **Public Benchmarking**: The presence of global leaders (Bata/Service/Aldo) provides a locked "Industry Physics" anchor for all mid-market targets.

## 3. The Protocol: Mapping Signals to PE Priorities

We do not just report data; we translate "Outside-In" signals into the financial metrics that drive your Investment Committee (IC) decisions.

### 3.1 Throughput Verification $\rightarrow$ **Revenue Durability**
*   **Signal**: Aggregated Customs Manifests vs. Claimed Sales Growth.
*   **Diligence Value**: Detects "Channel Stuffing" or inventory stagnation. If import volumes are dropping while sales claims are rising, revenue durability is compromised.

### 3.2 Yield Gap Analysis $\rightarrow$ **Margin Stability & Capital Intensity**
*   **Signal**: Store-level throughput vs. Public Peer Physics (RPSF - Revenue per Sq Ft).
*   **Diligence Value**: Identifies "Trapped Capital." If the target turns stock at 1.5x while the peer standard is 3.5x, we quantify the immediate EBITDA upside achievable through inventory professionalization.

### 3.3 Sentiment Integrity $\rightarrow$ **Brand Terminal Value (Exit Optionality)**
*   **Signal**: Audited External Sentiment Indices vs. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Proxies.
*   **Diligence Value**: Assesses brand decay. A high sentiment gap indicates a "dying" brand that will suffer from margin compression and low exit terminal value.

## 4. The ORBITAL Risk Index (Scoring Protocol)

We provide a numeric, repeatable framework for side-by-side deal comparison. The score quantifies the **Variance between Physical Signals and Financial Claims.**

| Index Range | Color | Classification | Institutional Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **< 30** | 🟢 | **High Fidelity** | Minimal variance detected; signals verify growth claims. |
| **30 - 60** | 🟡 | **Efficiency Gap** | Consistent revenue but significant "Trapped Capital" risk. |
| **60 - 85** | 🟠 | **Signal Divergence** | Material discrepancies in trade/traffic; high risk zone. |
| **> 85** | 🔴 | **Diagnostic Failure** | Immediate Red Flag; likely misrepresentation of assets/sales. |

## 6. The 30-Day Validation Roadmap: The "Stylo" Pilot

We validate the protocol through a focused "Mock-Audit" of a major private target.

1.  **Back-Testing (Days 1–15)**: Run the "Footwear Protocol" on 3 historical Pakistan exits. Prove that the ORBITAL Risk Index predicted the operational leakage.
2.  **The "Stylo" Benchmark**: Execute a full "Outside-In" audit of Stylo Shoes. Use this as the "High-Resolution Proof" to show to PE firms.
3.  **Partner Pilots**: Onboard 2 boutique firms to screen their live pipeline.

## 7. Conclusion: Neutralizing Asset-Selection Risk

ORBITAL BAE does not replace the human consultant; it empowers the investor to avoid the "Lemon" deals that human consultants often take months to catch. In the Footwear sector, the truth is on the ship and in the street. ORBITAL finds it first.
