## 1. The Variable of Truth: "Tower Yield"
In the KSA landscape, Capex is the biggest capital drag. The "Truth" isn't the number of subscribers; it is the **Economic Density per Tower.**

| Signal | Logic | Benchmark (KSA Standard) |
|---|---|---|
| **Tower Yield Index** | Total Subscribers / Total Tower Count | ~1,500 - 2,200 Subs/Tower |
| **Share Intensity** | % of Towers with 2+ Operators (Co-location) | 45% - 60% (Post-TAWAL Merger) |
| **Asset Density Delta** | Signal Coverage Area / Total Dishes (Booster Efficiency) | < 3 Dishes per Major Cell Site |

## 2. Deterministic Signals (The 10 Operators)

### A. Infrastructure Physics
1.  **Tower-to-Revenue Ratio**: Does the revenue growth justify the steel in the ground?
2.  **Generator Dependency Index**: Opex variance in desert vs. urban (Diesel/Solar mix).
3.  **Backhaul Efficiency**: Fiber-to-Tower ratio (Reducing microwave dish dependency).

### B. Subscriber Physics
4.  **ARPU-to-Opex Spread**: Average Revenue Per User vs. Network Maintenance Cost.
5.  **Multi-SIM Churn Hazard**: Subscriber prevalence (175%) indicates high multi-SIM fragility.
6.  **5G Adoption Velocity**: Spectrum conversion rate from LTE to NR.

### C. Financial Physics
7.  **Capex Efficiency (Gearing)**: New tower Capex vs. Incremental Data Revenue.
8.  **Roaming Revenue Sharing**: Settlement balance between STC/Mobily/Zain.
9.  **Fintech/Digital Conversion**: STC Pay / Mobily Pay adoption as a "Sticky Anchor."
10. **Vision 2030 Alignment**: Government project revenue (NEOM/The Line) as a capital anchor.

## 3. The "KSA Benchmarks" (2024 Gold Standard)

*   **STC (The King)**: 55% Market Share. High tower yield. Low dependency on external sharing. 
*   **Mobily (The Challenger)**: 24% Share. High infrastructure efficiency (Du/Etisalat DNA).
*   **Zain (The Asset-Light)**: 16% Share. Highest sharing intensity (Divested towers to Golden Lattice).

## 4. The Boardroom Verdict Strategy
If ORBITAL detects a **Tower Yield < 1,200**, the company is **Trapped in Steel.**
If ORBITAL detects a **Generator Dependency > 40%** in non-desert zones, it is a **Mechanical Inefficiency.**

**ORBITAL INDEX CALIBRATION:**
*   **GREEN (Strong)**: > 2,000 Subs/Tower + > 50% Sharing Intensity.
*   **AMBER (Warning)**: High 5G Capex with flat ARPU growth.
*   **RED (Leak)**: Duplicated infrastructure in low-density regions.
