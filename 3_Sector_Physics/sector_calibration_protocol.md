## 3. The "Sector Sprint" Strategy (Mass Pre-profiling)
To ensure the app is "Fast on Day 1," we move from "On-Demand" to **"Mass Pre-profiling."**

### 48-Hour Mission: Unlocking the Top 10
We will execute 15-minute calibration cycles for these primary Pakistan industries:

### Phase 3: Formatting & Logic Lock (Minutes 11 - 15)
*   **Action**: Hard-code the variables into `[sector]_signals.json`.
*   **Method**: Fixed weights and formulas.
*   **Crucial Step**: **Manual Sign-off**. The "Calibration" is only finalized once the Operator confirms the weights are strategically lethal.
*   **Outcome**: **Sector Unlocked.**

1.  **Textiles** (Unlocked)
2.  **Footwear** (Unlocked)
3.  **Cement** (Truth Anchor: Coal/Clinker vs Production)
4.  **Automobiles** (Truth Anchor: CKD Imports vs Unit Sales)
5.  **Pharmaceuticals** (Truth Anchor: API Imports vs Revenue)
6.  **Fertilizers** (Truth Anchor: Gas Allocation vs Output)
7.  **FMCG / Food** (Truth Anchor: Distribution Reach vs Sentiment)
8.  **Chemicals** (Truth Anchor: Feedstock vs Yield)
9.  **Power / IPPs** (Truth Anchor: Transmission Data)
10. **Retail (Tier-1)** (Truth Anchor: Footfall vs POS)

### Result
Once these 10 are stored in the **Sector Library**, any report in these categories is a **3-5 Minute** process immediately.
