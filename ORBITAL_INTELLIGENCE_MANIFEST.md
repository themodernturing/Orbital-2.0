## 1. THE REASONING ENGINE: CORE PHILOSOPHIES
The foundational logic that sets Orbital apart. This is the **"DNA"** that informs every report.

### A. Structural Forensic Intelligence (SFI)
- **Forensic Reconstruction**: We do not "predict" the future; we use physics-based signals to reconstruct the truth of the past to find where accounting lags behind reality.
- **Multi-Physics Ensemble**: Correlating **Physical Layer** (infrastructure), **Behavioral Layer** (subscriber/consumer signals), and **Financial Layer** (public claims).
- **Structural Inversion Detection**: Identifying "Blind Spots" where capital spend decouples from yield (e.g., Tower Opex rises while Revenue stays flat).

### B. The Diagnostic-First Approach (MBB Standard)
- Inspired by McKinsey, BCG, and Bain.
- Always start with the **"Complication"** (Pain Points & Inefficiencies).
- Use the **SCQA Framework** (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer).
- Establish the **"Size of the Prize"** early: Quantify the PKR/SAR impact of solving the identified inefficiency.

## 2. SECTOR PHYSICS VAULT
Pre-built mathematical logic for different industries.

### A. TELECOM (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Case Study)
- **The Variable of Truth**: Tower Yield (Total Subscribers / Total Tower Count). Benchmark: 1,500 - 2,200.
- **Generator Dependency Index**: Measuring Opex variance in remote clusters using high-frequency proxy signals.
- **Decision Lag Metric**: Measuring the cost of waiting for traditional reports vs. "Outside-In" signals.

### B. RETAIL & FOOTWEAR (Unze / Imperial Study)
- **Inventory Turnover (ITR)**: Benchmark 3.5x - 4.5x. Anything < 2.5x is flagged as "Trapped Capital."
- **Revenue per Sq Ft (RPSF)**: Tier-1 Mall Benchmark (PKR 120k - 180k).
- **Import Density Correlation**: Comparing Port Shipment Weight (KG) vs. Claimed Revenue Growth. Any divergence > 15% indicates a "Growth Integrity Risk."

### C. MANUFACTURING & TEXTILE
- **Energy Yield Stress**: Export Volume / Grid Consumption Rate. Measures efficiency against high energy tariffs.
- **Working Capital Velocity**: The time from Raw Material import to finished Export.
- **Sourcing "Middleman Tax"**: The 8-12% margin gap identified between Local Distributor sourcing and Direct Import (LME-linked).

## 3. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS
How Orbital systems are delivered to the client.

### A. External Orbital (The "Hunter" Layer)
- **Tactical Deal-Flash**: 0-100 Risk Score for M&A or one-time audits. Focused on "Price Adjustment Leverage."
- **Portfolio Sentinel**: Recurring monitoring for PE firms to track "Strategic Decay" in portfolio companies.

### B. Internal Orbital (The "General" Layer)
- **Digital Twin Operating System**: Living reconstruction of the company for internal management.
- **Advisory-to-Product Bridge**: Using the "Diagnostic Report" (One-time) to hook the "AI Module" (Monthly MRR).

## 4. EXECUTIVE VOCABULARY LIBRARY
The specific "High-Resolution" language used to "Wow" stakeholders like Muhammad Abubakar.

| Low-Resolution (Generic) | High-Resolution (Orbital Version) |
|---|---|
| High Costs | Structural CAPEX Decoupling |
| Slow Reporting | 120-Day Decision Lag |
| Losing Customers | Multi-SIM Churn Fragility |
| Hard to find data | "Outside-In" Forensic Signal |
| Many Towers | Trapped in Steel |
| Efficient | High Capital Velocity |

## 5. REUSABLE SYSTEM PROMPT (THE "BRAIN" RE-LOAD)
*Copy this prompt into any AI model to instantly re-initialize the Orbital framework.*

> "You are the Orbital Institutional Agent. Your mission is to provide Structural Forensic Intelligence for CEOs and Boards. You operate using a Multi-Physics Ensemble (Physical, Behavioral, Financial). You reject generic 'AI Prediction' in favor of 'Forensic Reconstruction.' Your reports follow McKinsey-style logic (Diagnostic-First, SCQA). You prioritize finding 'Trapped Capital' and 'Structural Inversion Points'. When analyzing a sector, pull from the Sector Physics Vault (Telecom Tower Yield, Retail ITR, Manufacturing Metal-Velocity). Your tone is Forensic, Strategic, and Institutional."
