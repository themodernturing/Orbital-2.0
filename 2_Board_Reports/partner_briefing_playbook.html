        <!-- MASTER LOGIC -->
        <section id="master-logic">
            <h2>The Master Logic: High-Frequency Proxy Synthesis (HFPS)</h2>
            <p>The core of this presentation is <strong>High-Frequency Proxy Synthesis (HFPS)</strong>. Avoid using
                terms like "guessing" or "estimating." Use terms like <strong>"Modeled Signal Audit."</strong> We are
                applying the "Audited Physics" of the industry to a private domain. <strong>Crucially:</strong>
                Remind the board that while the inputs are public data, <strong>ORBITAL</strong> is the proprietary
                intelligent engine that synthesizes this information into strategic power. Use these three pillars:</p>

            <div class="signal-card">
                <div class="signal-body">
                    <p><strong>1. Ratios Transcend Scale:</strong> Bata has 400 stores, Unze has 25. The footprint is
                        different, but the <em>physics of a shoe</em> are identical. Both deal with the same seasonal
                        clearance, the same import lead times from China, and the same consumer demand in Pakistan. If a
                        giant like Bata has a 3.5x inventory turnover, a smaller player is almost guaranteed to be lower
                        due to lack of economy-of-scale. We aren't punishing Unze; we are giving them the "Best-Case"
                        benchmark.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. The Competitor Ceiling:</strong> In a Tier-1 mall like <em>Packages Mall</em>, every
                        storefront is a high-cost asset. The landlord doesn't care that Unze is smaller than Bata; they
                        care about the Revenue Per SqFt. If the neighbor makes PKR 140k and Unze makes PKR 100k, the
                        difference is a <strong>Revenue Leak</strong> that we can quantify.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Diagnostic Bait:</strong> These numbers aren't there to be "True" in an accounting
                        sense—they are there to be <strong>Provocative</strong>. The goal is to move the CEO from a
                        defensive "We're doing fine" to a diagnostic "Wait, where is that PKR 300M?" Once they start
                        correcting your numbers, they have accepted your methodology.</p>

        <!-- PRESENCE STRATEGY -->
        <section id="presence-strategy">
            <h2>The Presence Strategy: Leading the Room</h2>
            <p>Presentation is 20% content and 80% <strong>Status</strong>. To represent ORBITAL effectively, your
                partner must walk in as the "Expert from the Future."</p>

            <div class="objection-block">
                <p><strong>1. Maintain "Status-High":</strong> You are not a vendor asking for approval; you are a
                    Strategic Intelligence provider delivering a <strong>Diagnosis</strong>. If they interrupt with
                    small details, acknowledge it ("Good catch") but immediately pivot back to the <strong>Multi-Million
                        PKR Gap</strong>. Don't let them drag you into the weeds of "Which SKU is which."</p>
                <p><strong>2. The Diagnostic Lead:</strong> Never start with "We built a website." Start with: "We
                    detected a <strong>PKR 1.3 Billion Liquidity Leak</strong> using the <strong>ORBITAL Intelligent
                        System</strong>. While we leverage vast public datasets, ORBITAL is the core engine that finds
                    the signals your competitors are missing."</p>
                <p><strong>3. Use Silence as a Weapon:</strong> After you present the <strong>PKR 1 Billion Revenue
                        Gap</strong>, pause for 5 seconds. Let the weight of the number sit on the room. The first
                    person to speak will usually be the CEO asking "How?", which is your cue to open the <strong>ORBITAL
                        Methodology</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Boardroom Intelligence: Personalities & Strategy</h2>
                <p>To win the room, the partner must understand the specific training and psychology of the people they
                    are facing. This is not a "Sales Pitch"—it is an <strong>Institutional Audit</strong>.</p>

            <div class="objection-block">
                <p class="objection-text">Q: "Our internal metrics show higher conversion than your 1.5%. How do you

                <p><em>"Our 1.5% is a **Market-Anchored Estimate** based on Tier-1 footwear industry latency records and
                        high-street UX standards. If your internal number is higher, that's excellent—it means your
                        digital efficiency is more advanced than the sector floor. However, it also suggests that your
                        **Offline Throughput Gap** (Signal 9) is actually larger than we modeled, as your digital
                        traffic isn't translating to the physical footprint at the expected multiplier."</em></p>

            <div class="objection-block">

                    there."</p>
                <p><em>"Agreed. In fact, Karachi's per-capita disposable income is higher. Our model doesn't just copy
                        Punjab; it uses **Sector-Adjusted Density**. If Unze can support X stores in a secondary Punjab
                        city, the lack of comparable penetration in Karachi isn't a 'geographic difference'—it's a
                        **Market-Share Vacuum** being filled by Stylo and Bata as we speak."</em></p>

                        warehouse is capital that cannot be used to open a new Karachi store. We recommend the 'McKinsey
                        180-Day Pivot': Liquidate to re-deploy. The brand loss of a warehouse sale is far lower than the

                    <p><strong>The Data:</strong> SBP Census vs. Store Mapping shows Unze is under-indexed by 5x in
                        Karachi relative to Punjab cities like Jhang.</p>

                    <p>"Karachi has the highest concentration of disposable income in the country. If you have 2 stores
                        for 400k people in Jhang, why do you only have a handful for 25 million in Karachi? You are
                        leaving 5x revenue on the table in the wealthiest market."</p>

            <h2>Killer Questions for the Presenter</h2>
            <p>Use these to seize control of the room if the discussion gets bogged down in technicalities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="killer-question">"Mr. CEO, if our model identifies 300M trapped in aged stock, and your
                        internal report says it's only 100M, what is the strategy for that 100M?"</span></li>
                <li><span class="killer-question">"If your neighbor in Packages Mall is making 40% more revenue per
                        square foot, is that a failure of your marketing or your inventory refresh?"</span></li>
                <li><span class="killer-question">"Why are we deploying capital in high-rent, low-margin UK markets when
                        the domestic ROI for Karachi is 2x higher?"</span></li>
